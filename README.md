# simple script ideas 
this repo will contain scripts that i am currently using to ease my own workflow.
1. delete_empty_notes.sh
	- this is a bash script to delete any files that are empty so my notes can stay more focused and rid of any ideas that were left behind (i guess)
	- this script is executed in a cronjob every 4 minutes
